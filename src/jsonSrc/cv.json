    "About me": "I sparked my interest in programming as a hobby a year ago while working in IT industry as a 3d artist. Since that I have found myself in love with coding and I decided to take it seriously and get a job.    Today I`m studying front-end fulltime. I`d like to get a junior position, I love working in a team. Real projects would boost my learning curve and I`d do my best at the company.   I have ~0.5 year of experience with JS and front-end tech (and I did Java and C++ courses prior to that). I am good at core JS + html/CSS  + currently learning React.",
